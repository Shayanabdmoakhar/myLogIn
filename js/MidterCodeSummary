// Summary of the file function

// This JavaScript code is for a login system where users can log in, view their profile, and see other users' profiles in a dashboard.
// Below is a breakdown of how it works:
// 1. User Data:
// The users array contains information about different users, like their name, email, net worth, and role (admin or regular user). Each user also has a userName and password for login.
// 2. Login Form:
// When the page loads a login form is shown. This form includes inputs for entering a username and password and also a background video is displayed.
// 3. Username and Password Validation:
// There are two functions:
// userNameVal() checks if the username is empty or has spaces, and makes sure the username matches one in the users list.
// userPassVal() does the same for the password, checking if it’s empty or has spaces, and ensuring the password matches the one for the given username.
// 4. Dashboard Display:
// If the login is successful, the system shows the logged-in user’s profile (name, email, role) who can see other profiles based on his/her role.
// If the logged-in user is an admin, it shows all other users (admins and users).
// If the user is a regular user, it only shows admin profiles.
// All the profiles are displayed in a grid layout using the Masonry layout for a neat, responsive design.
// 5. Buttons and Interactions:
// After login, the "Log In" button disappears, and the user profile cards appear.
// There is a "Log Out" button that hides the profile cards and shows the login form again.
// Each user card has a "Close Account" button. Only admins can remove cards from the dashboard by clicking this button.
// 6. Responsive Design:
// The layout is created to be responsive so that it adjusts on different screen sizes. The profile cards are arranged in grid and the layout automatically updates when a card is removed.
// 7. Error Handling:
// If the user leaves the username or password field empty, or if they enter incorrect details, the system shows an error message and asks them to fix it.
// In Short:
// This code allows users to log in, view their own profile, and see a list of other users. Admins can see all users, while regular users can only see admins.
//The system ensures the form inputs are valid and shows user profiles in a neat, responsive grid layout.
//admins have deletion power only on user account.
